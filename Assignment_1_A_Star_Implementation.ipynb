In a different maze, it could have easily found a suboptimal path because it overestimates the cost, potentially tricking the algorithm into ignoring the actual best route. It's important to note that it explored fewer nodes, which is a common trait of more \"aggressive\" (non-admissible) heuristics.\n",
