Lecture 1: Introduction to Graph Search

In this lecture, we begin with the basics of graph traversal.
We focus on two important algorithms:
1. Breadth First Search (BFS)
2. Depth First Search (DFS)

Key Points:
- Graphs can be represented using adjacency lists or adjacency matrices.
- BFS uses a queue (FIFO) to explore nodes level by level.
- DFS uses recursion or a stack (LIFO) to go deep before backtracking.
- Both algorithms are fundamental for exploring paths, connectivity, and solving shortest path problems in unweighted graphs.

This lecture introduces practical coding tasks:
- Implement BFS and DFS
- Compare traversal orders
- Visualize graph structures
- Apply BFS for shortest path in an unweighted graph
