Graph Evaluation Format

The evaluation of graph traversal tasks is based on:
1. Correctness of BFS implementation
2. Correctness of DFS implementation
3. Comparison and explanation of differences between BFS and DFS
4. Application of BFS for shortest path problems
5. Code readability and simplicity
6. Use of comments and clarity of explanation
7. Visualization of graph structure and traversal

Marks Distribution:
- BFS Implementation: 20%
- DFS Implementation: 20%
- BFS vs DFS Comparison: 20%
- Shortest Path BFS: 20%
- Code Style and Documentation: 20%
